SVG Preparation Notes:
  Covert shapes (e.g. circles, rectangles) to paths
  	- can use "find" menu to verify that all shapes are converted
  Add additional control points to circles and ellipses to change Arcs to Cubic Beziers
  Select all and group objects together then:
  	- adjust the width and height (in pixels) in the top bar
  	- set x and y to zero
  In "Document Properties":
  	- click "resize page to drawing or selection"
  	- in "scale" section, select a scale of 1 user unit per pixel
  	- verify that the zoom box is 0 0 width height (in pixels)
  Select all and group, then ungroup as many times as needed to remove all subgroups
  Save a copy using the "optimized SVG" option. This eliminates extra Inkscape clutter


Icon Sizes

The top-bar icons were 22 pixels tall (44 in retina mode, as shown below)
New UI top-bar SVG icons should be 24 pixels tall

Here are the old embedded (PNG) icon sizes; these are for retina mode):

gp> ed = (first (allInstances 'MicroBlocksEditor'))

gp> print (languageButtonIcon ed)
<Bitmap 40x40>

gp> print (settingsButtonIcon ed)
<Bitmap 44x44>

gp> print (projectButtonIcon ed)
<Bitmap 33x44>

gp> print (graphIcon ed)
<Bitmap 48x44>

gp> print (connectButtonIcon ed)
<Bitmap 50x45>

gp> print (zoomOutIcon ed)
<Bitmap 40x40>

gp> print (restoreZoomIcon ed)
<Bitmap 40x40>

gp> print (zoomInIcon ed)
<Bitmap 40x40>

gp> print (bunnyIcon ed)
